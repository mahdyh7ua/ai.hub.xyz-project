lncvjdThe ideal privacy balance in Web3 lies between full anonymity and full transparency. Total anonymity breeds scams and unaccountability, while total transparency kills individual freedom. The sweet spot is selective disclosure — letting users prove legitimacy or ownership without revealing personal data. It preserves trust in decentralized systems while protecting users from surveillance or misuse. This balance is what keeps Web3 both open and human-centered.
