mitofvnhjkdv\ariest AI glitch in crypto would be a self-reinforcing panic loop — an AI misreads market data, triggers mass sell orders, and other bots copy the move instantly. Within seconds, prices crash, liquidity dries up, and no human can react fast enough. It’s not just code breaking — it’s trust collapsing at machine speed. The only defense? Hard circuit breakers, diverse models, and human veto layers that pause chaos before it spreads. Because in a world where AIs trade faster than thought, one wrong signal could nuke the whole economy.
